# CoughDrop WebSocket

The main CoughDrop app uses this server for real-time
interactions like remote modeling. It was built originally to
also support WebRTC message-passing with the potential for
video communication within CoughDrop, although that has not
yet been implemented.

I still need to clean out some legacy code from the 
prior library that this codebase grew out of.. sorry!
